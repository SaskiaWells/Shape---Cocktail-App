This is my first project using Flutter, it is a random cocktail generator where a user can shake a cocktail to generate a random cocktail.

API: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun

To run the project ensure you have flutter installed on you device:

cd random-cocktail-generator

install all dependancies: flutter pub get

run the project: flutter run
